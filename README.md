# 🥁 JS Drum Kit

## 📌 Project Description
The **JS Drum Kit** is an interactive web-based drum simulator that allows users to play different drum sounds using their keyboard. Each key corresponds to a unique drum sound, such as a snare, kick, hi-hat, or tom. This project is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## 🎯 Features
✅ Play drum sounds by pressing keyboard keys  
✅ Smooth and responsive playback  
✅ Visual feedback with animations  
✅ Background image for enhanced UI  
✅ Lightweight and simple UI  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML** → For structuring the drum keys
- **CSS** → For styling and visual effects
- **JavaScript** → For handling key events and playing sounds

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Press a specific key on your keyboard (e.g., `A` for a **clap** sound).
2. JavaScript detects the key press and plays the corresponding sound.
3. A visual effect highlights the key when pressed.
4. The effect disappears after the animation ends.
5. A background image is displayed for a visually appealing interface.
